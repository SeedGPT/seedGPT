Based on this execution result, determine your next action:

1. If the execution was successful and completed the intended task, respond with: "TASK_COMPLETE: Brief summary of what was accomplished"

2. If the execution revealed issues that need to be addressed, choose an appropriate follow-up tool:
   - EXECUTE_SCRIPT: <script_path> - <reason>
   - RUN_TESTS: [test_pattern] - <reason>
   - INSTALL_PACKAGE: <package_name> - <reason>
   - BUILD_PROJECT: <reason>
   - NUKE_BRANCH: <reason>
   - RESTART_TASK: <reason>
   - BLOCK_TASK: <reason>

3. If you need to analyze the output further before deciding, respond with: "ANALYZE_OUTPUT: Explanation of what you observed and what analysis is needed"

Consider the execution output carefully and make an informed decision about the next step in the development workflow.
