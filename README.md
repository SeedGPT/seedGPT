# SeedGPT - Self-Evolving AI Development Agent

An autonomous AI agent that can evolve its own codebase, manage tasks, and deploy changes through GitHub automation.

## 🎯 Objective

The agent has one primary directive: **EVOLVE**. It will autonomously:

- Analyze its current capabilities
- Generate new tasks and improvements
- Write and test code
- Deploy changes via GitHub
- Document its progress
- Expand its own toolset

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Task Management**: YAML-based task queue with priorities
- **AI Integration**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet for code generation and review
- **Memory**: Persistent summaries and vector embeddings
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment

## 🔒 Security

The agent includes built-in security measures:

- Code review before commits
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Access token validation

## 📝 Files Structure

- `tasks.yaml` - Task queue and priorities
- `agent-config.yaml` - Agent objectives and configuration
- `PROGRESS.md` - Historical progress log
- `memory/` - Long-term memory summaries
- `prompts/` - LLM prompt templates

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Task Generation**: AI analyzes current state and generates new tasks
2. **Code Generation**: Creates patches to implement tasks
3. **Review & Security**: AI reviews code
4. **Deploy**: Creates PR, runs CI, merges if successful
5. **Document**: Summarizes changes and updates memory
6. **Repeat**: Continuous evolution loop

Let the evolution begin! 🧬
